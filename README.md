<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a Python/Flask application using an API call Edemam and Chart.Js to present visually appealing data for the user. This was a solo project using a Trello board for task organization

This project was inspired for my family members to track their calories per day/week/month. They can search and save specific food that they have consumed throughout the day while also creating a goal for them to keep track of. I'm very passionate about this project as I get to help them visually see their intake and visual goals.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once logged in a user can search any food along with the serving amount that they've eaten throughout the day and save it. A list of calories, protien, and carbs will display.

A user can only save food if they create an account, the date calender will not appear if the user is not logged in.

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot2]](https://example.com)


Once the user has saved the meal per specific date, they will be redirected to their dashboard which will display all of their meals with each catogory totaled. I used Chart.js to display visually appealing data for the user. 

The graph on the right is displaying data of saved food totaled up by specific month, the user can use this information to compare their calories month to month.

The Doughnut Chart on the left is to display the information that is in the table but in a more user friendly way. The user can toggle a catogory in the chart and view it specifically. 


[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot3]](https://example.com)


As the user clicks on "View Meals By Date" on the dashboard page, they will come here a view their meals totaled by the date. I added this page to organize the data for the user. A delete button was made for the user if they felt like there was a mistake with some meals on that specific date.

The next page was very fun for me to make.


[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot4]](https://example.com)


I decided to add a feature where a user can input goals for the day to keep them on track. I first had issues accessing the page if a user did not have a goal input, I had to involve a bit of logic to allow the user access. 

Now if the use doesn't have any goal input, they will be able to see and emput chart and the three categories at 0. A button will display that says "Create A Goal".

*I added little notes for the user, which i will so make for the user to unput their own notes.*

Also, a table will show of all the meals per that day, along with a delete button.


[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot5]](https://example.com)


Once the user has inputted their goal for the day, the page will display their goal, current calorie count, and remaining calories. This will adjust as the user inputs more meals per that date as well as deleting data. I also put in a chart for a more visual appeal.
